## Graph Theory

Project created for gathering implementations for the Graph Theory (COS242) class from UFRJ.

### How to compile

In order to compile and execute the code containing the case studies, simply run the following command:
```bash
make run
```

By default, the case studies make use of the list data structure, but this can be easily changed on the `CaseStudies.cpp` class.
